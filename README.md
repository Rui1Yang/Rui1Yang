GIFI love connecting with different people so if you want to say hi, I'll be happy to meet you more! : )

The one on the below is Charmve（益达）, he will speak for me in the virtual world.

🔭 I’m currently writing some amateur open source projects, at @Maiwei.ai and @UFund by myself. A closed-loop studying open-source repo is public at https://charmve.github.io/computer-vision-in-action, and more interesting project can be found at My GitHub repos.
🌱 I’m currently working at Momenta.ai, a auto-drive company. Before that, I was employed at Future Security Labs of Qihoo 360 as a Research SDE. My research interests lie at Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
🤔 Only two things make me moved.
